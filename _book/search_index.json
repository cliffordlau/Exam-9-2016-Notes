between risk and expected return in equilibrium Assumes: All investors optimized portfolio using Markowitz procedure \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Construct efficient frontier based on all available risky assets \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Identify efficient risky portfolio P Investors face an identical investable universe and same input list to construct efficient frontier \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Same weights for each risky asset Since market portfolio is based on the same risky portfolios, it will have the same weights \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Investor will hold the market portfolio \\(\\Rightarrow\\) CAL = CML Mutual fund theorm: All investors hold a common risky portfolio, they would have no problem if all the stock in the market were replaced with shares of a single mutual fund holding the market portfolio Key implications: Market portfolio is efficient Premium on a risky asset is \\(\\propto\\) its \\(\\beta\\) 5.3 CAPM Assumptions Individual Behavior Assumptions Investors are rational mean-variance optimizers Not concerned about correlation of asset return with inflation/ prices of consumption items Single period planning horizon (can alter later) Longer periods would result in extra-market risk factors e.g. \\(\\Delta\\) interest rates \\(\\downarrow\\) income \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Assets that can hedge this will be priced higher Identical input list Implies that all information are public There are many investors and they are all price takers Transactions have no impact on the price Investors have homogeneous expectations Everyone’s analysis come to the same conclusion Market Structure Assumptions All assets are publicly traded (can alter later) and short positions are allowed Assets have to be tradable for investors to be able to derive identical input list Can borrow/lend at a common risk free rate (can alter later) Necessary for investors to derive the same tangency portfolio All information is publicly available No taxes Different tax rate \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Different after tax rates on the same stock \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Investor could derive different after tax optimal risky portfolio No transaction costs 5.3.1 Assumptions Testing Model Testing Normative: test model assumptions Positive: examines the predictions Impossible to create a model consistent with the complexity of markets \\(\\Rightarrow\\) CAPM is a simplification of reality \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Ideally assumptions will be robust (outcome not highly sensitive to the violation of the assumptions) 5.3.2 Derivation of CAPM Proved: Contribution of an individual stock to the portfolio risk premium is \\(w_i[\\operatorname{E}[r_i]-r_f]\\) Contribution of an individual stock the portfolio variance is \\(w_i \\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)\\) Reward-to-risk ratio based on above: \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Contribution to Risk Premium}}{\\text{Contribution to Variance}} = \\dfrac{w_i[\\operatorname{E}[r_i]-r_f]}{w_i \\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)} = \\dfrac{[\\operatorname{E}[r_i]-r_f]}{\\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)}\\) Reward-to-risk ratio for market portfolio is the market price of risk: \\(\\dfrac{[\\operatorname{E}[r_M]-r_f]}{\\sigma^2_M}\\) In equilibrium all securities should have the same reward-to-risk ratio \\(\\Rightarrow\\) reward-to-risk ratio for individual stock = market price of risk: \\(\\begin{array}{ccc} \\dfrac{[\\operatorname{E}[r_i]-r_f]}{\\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)} &amp;= \\dfrac{[\\operatorname{E}[r_M]-r_f]}{\\sigma^2_M} \\\\ \\operatorname{E}[r_i] &amp;= r_f + \\beta_i [\\operatorname{E}[r_M] - r_f] &amp;\\text{where } \\beta_i = \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)}{\\sigma^2_M} \\\\ \\end{array}\\) 5.3.3 Security Market Line \\(\\beta\\) measures the risk of the security Can be estimated by plotting XS return on stock vs XS return on market Intercept should be 0 Security Market Lines Graphs relationship between \\(\\beta\\) and \\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) of a stock alt text SML vs CML CML: Risk premium of efficient Portfolios vs \\(\\sigma\\) \\(\\sigma\\) is the appropriate risk measure for portfolios SML: Risk premium of individual asseets vs \\(\\beta\\) \\(\\beta\\) is the appropriate risk measure for individual securities held as part of a well diversified portfolio 5.3.4 Testing CAPM Impossible to construct market portfolio, so test the SML equation instead \\(\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_i R_M\\) Regression on the XS returns of a sample of stocks against their betas over time \\(R_{i,t} = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1 \\beta_i + \\lambda_2 \\sigma^2(e_i) + \\eta_{i,t}\\) CAPM predicts: \\(\\lambda_0 = 0\\) as the average \\(\\alpha = 0\\) \\(\\lambda_1 = R_M\\) as the slope of SML = market risk premium \\(\\lambda_2 = 0\\) as the risk premium is only based on proportion of market risk premium Estimate the \\(\\beta\\) and residual variance for each stock from time series of stock return Caveat Parameter estimates have large errors and may be correlated \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Downward bias in \\(\\lambda_1\\) and upward bias on \\(\\lambda_0\\) Might reject CAPM even if it is valid Returns simulated following CAPM but regression still indicates that CAPM does not hold Parameters are time varying but the regression techniques does not recognize this 5.4 CAPM Extensions Problematic assumptions: No restrictions on short sales, but in reality it can be difficult to take short positions All assets are tradable No transaction costs Single period horizon However the extensions of CAPM are not perfect so none have superseded CAPM so far 5.4.1 Zero Beta CAPM When investors face borrowing restrictions of risk free asset \\(\\operatorname{E}[r_i] = \\operatorname{E}[r_Z] + \\beta_i \\left[\\operatorname{E}[r_M] - \\operatorname{E}[r_Z]\\right]\\) \\(Z\\) = zero-beta portfolio for M Uncorrelated portfolio on the inefficient side of the minimum-variance frontier Investors with borrowing restrictions will invest more in high \\(\\beta\\) stocks and less in low \\(\\beta\\) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\uparrow\\) price of high \\(\\beta\\) stocks Slopt of \\(SML_{zb} &lt; SML_{reg}\\) Risk premium on the market portfolio is smaller as the \\(\\operatorname{E}[r_Z] &gt; r_f\\) so less reward for bearing risk 5.4.2 Non-Traded Assets Some assets are tradable e.g. human capital and privately held business These are of significant values and can have a material impact on the equilibrium returns of traded securities Privately held business Privately held business w/ similar characteristics to traded assets: Little impact to CAPM as owners can still achieve diversification by reducing their portfolio of other similar traded assets \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Still holding market portfolio Privately held business w/o similar characteristics to traded assets: Portfolio of traded assets that hedge the private business will be up \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(\\downarrow\\) expected return \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(-\\alpha\\) in traditional CAPM Human Capital Only way to hedge is for employees to avoid purchasing share of their own employer \\(\\Rightarrow\\) labor intensive firms will have lower demand \\(\\Rightarrow\\) \\(+\\alpha\\) in traditional CAPM Adjusted CAPM for labor income: \\(\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\operatorname{E}[R_M] \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_M) + \\frac{P_H}{P_M}\\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_H)}{\\sigma^2_M + \\frac{P_H}{P_M}\\operatorname{Cov}(R_M,R_H)}\\) \\(P_H\\): value of aggregate human capital \\(P_M\\): market value of traded assets Adjustment produce lower \\(\\beta\\) so a SML with a less steep slope, which explain negative alpha of high beta securities indicated by some tests 5.4.3 Multiperiod CAPM Intertemporal CAPM Assume investors will optimize their consumption/ investment over their lifetime ICAPM = CAPM when: Only type of risk is the uncertainty about portfolio returns Investment opportunities are constant over time However, over the long run we expect additional sources of risk to arise and hedge portfolios will be bid up Changes in the parameters that describe investment opportunities Investors will bid up prices of assets that have higher return during periods of adverse economic environment \\(\\Rightarrow\\) lower expected return Changes in the prices of consumption goods Investors will bid up prices of assets that hedge the increases in prices of consumption goods (inflation protection) ICAPM with \\(K\\) sources of extramarket risk and \\(K\\) hedge portfolios: \\(\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_{iM}\\operatorname[R_M] + \\sum_k \\beta_{ik}\\operatorname[R_k]\\) \\(\\beta_{ik}\\) is the \\(\\beta\\) on the \\(k\\)th hedge portfolio 5.4.4 Consumption Based CAPM Assume that in a period, investors need to allocate the current wealth between consumption today and savings/ investments to support future consumption Optimal mix: utility from an additional dollar of consumption today = utility associated with the future consumption generated from the investment of that dollar Additional income from savings are more valued during tough economic times (w/ limited consumption opportunities) \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Assets with (+) covariance with consumption growth (higher payoff when consumption is already high) are viewed as riskier \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Risk premium higher CCAPM: \\(\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_{iC}RP_C\\) \\(C\\) is a consumption tracking portfolio, one with the highest correlation with consumption growth \\(\\beta\\) of market portfolio can be &gt; 1 Disadvantages: consumption growth figures are published infrequently and with significant error 5.4.5 Liquidity Adjusted CAPM Security prices should be discounted to reflect illiquidity Standard CAPM ignores liquidity costs like bid-ask spread Discount \\(\\uparrow\\) as trading cost \\(\\uparrow\\) but not proportional to the increase due to clientele effect Frequent traders hold more liquid assets and long term traders hold less liquid assets Investor also demand additional return on liquidity risk (risk of unanticipated changes in liquidity) Can be adjusted with liquidity \\(\\beta\\) that reflects the sensitivity of the return of the security to changes in market liquidity 5.5 Past Exam Questions 2015, Q4 "],

Difficulties in determining if the markets are truly efficient: Magnitude Issue: 0.1% of a huge portfolio will be a big dollar term contribution but very small compared to the normal volatility of the market \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Hard to assess how much the manager actually contributed Selection Bias Issue: Investment scheme that are known by others will no longer generate abnormal returns \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Only schemes that do not work will be reported Lucky Event Issue: The number of investors is so large so that just by chance some will have to make huge returns 7.5.1 Tests of Different EMH Forms Tests can be constructed for each version of EMH 7.5.1.1 Weak-Form Tests Patterns in stock returns Returns over short horizons Measure serial correlation of stock market returns to see whether investors can use historical trends to earn abnormal profits over the short term Results show only small correlations over short periods Exception being sectors with the best and worst returns exhibit stronger correlation, momentum effect Returns over long horizons Similar to above but for longer term Results show negative correlation over the long term \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Fads hypothesis maybe \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) A contrarian investment strategy may be profitable 7.5.1.2 Semi-strong Form Tests Efficient market anomalies Investigate whether publicly available information beyond the trading history can be used to generate abnormal returns Results show that some easily available diagnostics can be used to predict abnormal returns Small firm in January effect: Small firms have historically generate superior returns particularly in January Neglect firm effect: Some firms are neglected by large investors so less information is available. The superior returns might be due to additional premium required to compensate for the risk of less information Book:Market ratios: High B:M firm have historically outperformed the rest Post-earnings-announcement price drift: Cumulative abnormal return of stocks has been shown to continue to increase even after the information about the even become public Tests require the level of risk to be reflected \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Need to appropriately risk adjust the return, which can be more difficult than EMH itself 7.5.1.3 Strong Tests Markets are not expected to be strong-form efficient, people with inside information should be able to make superior profits 7.5.2 Intrepreting the Evidence Results above might still not be sufficient to show that the market is inefficient: Properties are only proxies for fundamental determinants of risk Properties arise just due to data mining and many of the anomalies disappear after discovered 7.5.3 Role of Portfolio Management Portfolio management can still be beneficial in efficient market Helps selects a diversification strategy to eliminate firm risk Reflects tax considerations of the individual investors Adjust portfolio to reflect the unique risk profile of the investor 7.5.4 Resource Allocation Inefficient resource allocation, deviations from market efficiency will generate a cost to everyone e.g. firms with overpriced securities will be able to obtain capital too cheaply 7.6 Mutual Fund and Analyst Performance 7.6.1 Stock Market Analysts Expect positive bias since they work for brokers Need to look at the relative strength of a recommendation compared to other analysts Or the change in recommendation of an analyst Study showed changes are associated with permanent change in stock prices \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Likely due to analyst’s insight Or instead the change is just due to the change in recommendation itself Another study indicates that firms with highest ratings do outperform those with the least favorable ratings However costs of trading would eliminate the additional profits 7.6.2 Mutual Fund Managers No evidence that managers can consistently beat the market There are some evidence that indicates better managers in a period tend to be better managers in following periods Adjusts tests above for exposure to systematic risk factors e.g. Risk adjust return XS of CAPM indication But market index may not be an adequate benchmark as managers may have significant holdings in small firms that’s not represented in the market index 4 Factor Fama French Model Benchmark return with 3 Fama French factors model + momentum factor \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Fund have not been shown to exceed this benchmark The 4 factor model also only show minor persistence in mutual fund performance, mostly due to expenses and transaction costs Another test from Bollen &amp; Busse was to rank mutual fund to decile and track results in the following quarters Results showed only small persistence that is not sufficient to justify performance chasing Argument supporting the lack of persistence is that fund that had good performance will attract new funds, driving the alpha down due to the additional cost &amp; complexity of managing the new funds Study of bond fund indicate that the bond fund under perform the passive indexes by the expense amount and with no persistence in performance \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Bond market is efficient 7.7 Past Exam Questions 2012, Q3 Weak form reflect all past market trading data. Technical analysis can’t generate XS returns Semi strong: price reflect all public information, fundamental analysis won’t benefit Strong form: all information is reflected. Unlikely this hold so fundamental analysis could work with non public information Lucky event: 50% for each of the 3 years is not impossible Wide variance in return and small difference, might just be random Companys might be taking on more risk to achieve higher returns 2014, Q6 "],

Segment their investment portfolios into pieces which go towards different goals and they will have different risk attitudes to each piece Regret Avoidance: Unconventional decisions that turned out to be wrong will have more regret Affect: Good or bad feeling investors may associate with investing in a stock E.g. Socially responsible firms may generate higher affect \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Drive up the prices as investors prefer them \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Lower risk adjusted returns Prospect Theory: Modifies the standard definition of risk averse investors Utility depends on changes in wealth instead of level of wealth There is diminishing return of utility as wealth increases but in addition it shows that investors become risk seeing as they begin to lose money alt text 8.3 Limits to Arbitrage Actions for arbitrageurs are limits \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Price irrationalities can continue Fundamental Risk: Mispricing are not necessarily going to disappear, so it’s not actually risk free Implementation Costs: There are limitations to short selling e.g. short notice to return the security and some investors are not permitted to short sell Model Risk: Fault in the arbitrageur’s model that falsely indicate a mispricing 8.4 Violations of the Law of One Price Examples where the law of one price has been violated 8.4.1 Siamese Twin Companies When Shell and Royal Dutch Petroleum merged, the profits are set to split 40/60 \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Royal Dutch shares should be 150% of Shells but the price relativity deviated from the 150% level for extended period Arbitrageurs who tried to profit may have lost money as there were periods of time where the deviations actually grew in size 8.4.2 Equity Carve-outs When 3Com spun off Palm, each 3Com shareholder gets 1.5 shares of Palm 3Com shares should be traded for at least 1.5x of Palm but Palm was traded for more Arbitrageurs were not able to exploit this by short selling Palm as not enough shares were available for short selling 8.4.3 Closed-End Funds They typically trade at discount or premium of net asset value Not a true violation as the fund incurs expenses which will reduce the share prices \\(\\dfrac{\\text{Premium}}{\\text{Net Asset Value}} = \\dfrac{\\text{Price} - \\text{NAV}}{\\text{NAV}} = \\dfrac{\\alpha - \\varepsilon}{\\delta + \\varepsilon - \\alpha}\\) \\(\\delta\\) = Dividend yield; \\(\\varepsilon\\) = Expense ratio Fund will sell at a premium is \\(\\alpha &gt; \\varepsilon\\) 8.5 Critique of Behavioral Finance Unstructured: Allows virtually any anomaly to be explained by a combination of irrationalities Critics would have more faith in behavioral finance if it provides a single behavioral characteristic that explains a range of anomalies Inconsistent: Some anomalies are inconsistent in their support for one irrationality vs another Benchmark: Picking the wrong benchmark can produce an apparent abnormality 8.6 Technical Analysis Behavioral Finance suggest that technical analysis will be successful in many cases due to irrationalities in decision making from investors Disposition effect where investors hold on to losing investments because they are reluctant to realize losses \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Slow down the adjustment of the share price to the appropriate value Overconfidence investors trade more \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Relationships between trading volume and market returns Technical analyst uses volume data to capture this Irrational factors can disturb market fundamentals and technical analysis can exploit the corrections 8.6.1 Trends &amp; Corrections Technical analysis has to do with uncovering trends Moving Averages Average stock price over an interval Falling stocks’ moving average &gt; current price If market breaks through the moving average line from below = bullish signal as it’s a sign of a shift from falling trend to rising trend Elliott wave theory Decomposes the actual movements into long term and short term wave cycles, buy when the long term direction is positive Relative Strength Measures how the stock has performed relative to the industry or market Ratio of the stock price vs market index Breadth Measures how widely the movement in the market index is reflected in the price movements of all stocks e.g. measure the spread between the # of stocks that advance and decline, as # of advances &gt; # of declines by a wider margin the market is viewed as being stronger 8.6.2 Sentiment Indicators Methods to measure market sentiment Trin Statistics Market advances are considered to be stronger when they are accompanied by stronger trading volumes \\(\\text{Trin} = \\dfrac{\\text{Vol. Declining}/\\text{# Declining}}{\\text{Vol. Advancing}/\\text{# Advancing}}\\) Ratio &gt; 1.0 are bearish Confidence Index Based on bond market data assuming actions of bond traders reveal trends that will later follow in the stock market \\(\\text{Confidence Index} = \\dfrac{\\text{Avg yield on top 10 rated corporate bonds}}{\\text{Avg yield on intermediate 10 rated corporate bonds}}\\) Approaches 100% when traders are optimistic as they’ll require smaller default premiums Put/ Call Ratio \\(\\dfrac{\\text{o/s put options}}{\\text{o/s call options}}\\) Increase in the ratio is a bearish sign as put options profit from falling markets 8.7 Past Exam Questions n/a "],

Not true market portfolio; sampling error of \\(\\beta\\); Can not borrow at risk free 2001, Q11: Improvement of CAPM to include state of economy (low and high bonds) and market value of equity (size) 9.2 Tests of CAPM Tests of various component of CAPM 9.2.1 Expected Return and Beta Early test of CAPM \\(\\operatorname{E}[r_i] = r_f + \\beta_i \\left( \\operatorname{E}[r_M] - r_f \\right)\\) 1) Sample data Select a sample period (e.g. 60mos) and for each incremental period (month) \\(t\\) collect: \\(r_{it}\\): rates of return of \\(n\\) stocks \\(r_{Mt}\\): market proxy (return?) \\(r_{ft}\\): risk free rate for the incremental period \\(t\\) (1 month) 2) Estimate SCL (Security Characteristic Line) \\(r_{it} - r_{ft} = \\alpha_i + b_i(r_{Mt} - r_{ft}) + e_{it}\\) Estimate \\(\\beta\\) via first-pass regression for each of the 100 stocks Recall SCL from BKM8 (\\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) vs \\(\\sigma\\)) 3) Estimate SML (Security Market Line) Estimate the \\(\\gamma\\)’s via the second-pass regression using the \\(n\\) \\(\\beta\\)s from the different companies in step 2 \\(\\overline{r_i - r_f} = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\beta_i + \\gamma_2 \\sigma^2(e_i)\\) \\(\\overline{r_i - r_f}\\) is the sample average over the periods for each stock \\(\\sigma^2(e_i)\\) is variance of the residual from the first pass (variance on the 60 months of residual) Recall SML from BKM9 (\\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) vs \\(\\beta\\)) Expected Results if CAPM is valid \\(\\gamma_0 = 0\\) \\(\\gamma_1 = \\overline{r_M - r_f}\\) \\(\\gamma_2 = 0\\) Test Results Neither \\(\\gamma_0\\) and \\(\\gamma_2\\) are 0 \\(\\gamma_1\\) is significantly less than the sample average \\(\\overline{r_M - r_f}\\) Caveat Several difficulties of this testing approach that might have caused the inconsistent results Stock results are volatile, reducing the accuracy of the tests that rely on return Concerns about the validity of the tests: Market index used is not the true market portfolio Large sample error of the \\(\\beta\\) estimates in the first-pass regression Investors can’t borrow at risk free 9.2.2 The Market Index Roll’s Critique The only testable hypothesis of CAPM is that the market portfolio is mean-variance efficient The other implications are based on the market portfolio’s efficiency and are not independently testable e.g. Linear relationship between \\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) and \\(\\beta\\) A given sample of observed individual returns can form an infinite number of ex post portfolios that are mean-variance efficient \\(\\Rightarrow\\) The \\(\\beta\\)s of these portfolio will satisfy the SML relation exactly regardless of whether the true market portfolio is mean-variance efficient CAPM is not testable unless we know the composition of the true market and use it in the test \\(\\Rightarrow\\) All assets are required to be included in the sample 2 difficulties with using proxy such as S&amp;P 500 Proxy may be mean-variance efficient even though the true market is not Most proxies are highly correlated with themselves and the true market Even if the S&amp;P is highly correlated, using a different coreelated proxy may result in different conclusion Benchmark error: use of incorrect benchmarks in the tests of the theory Roll &amp; Ross Critique Tests that reject a positive relationship between the average return &amp; \\(\\beta\\) is due to inefficiency in the proxy Kandel &amp; Stambaugh Zero-beta CAPM requires portfolio on the efficient frontier Need market proxy since we can not easily identify such a portfolio Market proxy was used to estimate a second pass regression for the zero-beta CAPM: \\(r_i - r_z = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\times \\hat{\\beta}_i\\) Kandel &amp; Stambaugh showed that the values of \\(\\gamma_0\\) and \\(\\gamma_1\\) would be biased by an amount \\(\\propto\\) the efficiency of the proxy \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) For the test to be valid, we need an efficient proxy but it is difficult to test how efficient the proxy is Given the difficulty in testing CAPM directly, easier to test APT instead, which produces the same SML given that the portfolio is well diversified 9.2.3 Measurement Error in Beta If the right handside variable of a regression equation is measured with error \\(\\Rightarrow\\) slope coefficient will be biased \\(\\downarrow\\) and the intercept biased \\(\\uparrow\\) \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) \\(\\beta\\) is measured with error in the second-pass regression \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Estimated \\(\\gamma_0\\) was \\(&gt; 0\\) and \\(\\gamma_1 &lt; \\overline{r_M - r_f}\\) Mill &amp; Scholes used simulated rates of return than followed CAPM in the first-pass regression to estimate \\(\\beta\\) but the results were identical to the results based on actual stock returns Test was not high power enough Modified test to reduce measurement error by using portfolios (instead of individual securities) to diversify away firm risk \\(\\Rightarrow\\) More accurate \\(\\beta\\) Caveat: Combining reduced the number of observations for the second-pass regression \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Portfolios were constructed to produce the largest possible dispersion of \\(\\beta\\) coefficients, as this results in more accurate regression estimates Fama &amp; MacBeth tested with the portfolios with the SML below: \\(r_i = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_1 \\beta_i + \\gamma_2 \\beta_i^2 + \\gamma_3 \\sigma(e_i)\\) \\(\\gamma_2\\) should be 0 based on CAPM but represents the potential nonlinearity \\(\\gamma_3\\) fluctuated a lot but was not significant \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Test did not reject CAPM but alternate datasets did reject the model 9.3 Tests of Multifactor CAPM &amp; APT Potential supplemental factor to the market risk is a multifactor SML Factors that hedge consumption against uncertainty of prices of important consumption categories or general inflation (CCAPM) Factors that hedge future investment opportunities ( ICAPM e.g. interest rates or market risk premium) Factors that hedge assets missing from the market index (non-traded asset e.g. labor income or private business) 9.3.1 Labor Income True market portfolio includes aggregate labor income that is (+)-ly correlated with the market index and have significant value compared to the value of securities in the index Stocks that have (+) \\(\\beta\\) on the value of labor will have lower prices as investor will try to hedge the risk of their human capital by avoiding those stocks Risk premium will be larger than indicated by the standard CAPM To capture human capital: Assume \\(\\Delta\\) aggregate labor income \\(\\approx\\) \\(\\Delta\\) value of human capital Difference between yields on low and high grade bonds \\(\\approx\\) state of the economy As business cycles may affect the asset \\(\\beta\\) (\\(\\beta\\) are conitional on the state of the economy) Incorporate firm size adjustment \\(ME\\), market value of equity \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) \\(\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = c_0 + c_{size} \\operatorname{log}(ME) + c_{vw}\\beta^{vw} + c_{prem}\\beta^{prem} + c_{labor}\\beta^{labor}\\) \\(\\beta^{vw}\\) is the \\(\\beta\\) of a value weighted index Test rejected CAPM 9.3.2 Macro Factor Model Variables that may be proxies fro systematic risk factors: \\(IP\\): Growth rate of industrial production \\(EI\\): \\(\\Delta\\) in expected inflation (based on \\(\\Delta\\) in short term interest rates) \\(UI\\): Unexpected inflation \\(CG\\): Unexpected \\(\\Delta\\) in risk premium (difference between returns of corporate Baa bonds &amp; long term government bonds) \\(GB\\): Unexpected \\(\\Delta\\) in the term premium (difference between returns of long term and short term government bonds) First-Pass Regression Groups stocks into 20 portfolio based on size Size is expected to be associated with average stock returns Based on 5 years of data, regression on each of the group \\(r = a + \\beta_M r_M + \\beta_{IP} IP + \\beta_{EI} EI + \\beta_{UI} UI +\\beta_{CG} CG + \\beta_{GB} GB + e\\) Second-Pass Regression \\(\\beta\\)s from first-pass regression were used for the second-pass regression on the 20 portfolios \\(r = \\gamma_0 + \\gamma_M \\beta_M + \\gamma_{IP} \\beta_{IP} + \\gamma_{EI} \\beta_{EI} + \\gamma_{UI} \\beta_{UI} +\\gamma_{CG} \\beta_{CG} + \\gamma_{GB} \\beta_{GB} + e\\) Regression was ran twice using value weighted NYSE and equally weighted NYSE Neither market index is statistically significant (\\(|t|\\) &lt; 2) \\(IP\\), \\(CG\\), and \\(UI\\) showed significant explanatory power 9.3.3 Fama French 3 Factor Model Divide stocks into 6 portfolio based on B:M ratios (Low Mid High) and size (Small Big) \\(\\operatorname{E}[r_i] - r_f = \\alpha_i + b_i [\\operatorname{E}[r_M] - r_f] + s_i \\operatorname{E}[SMB]+ h_i \\operatorname{E}[HML]\\) First-pass regression: to estimate factors \\(b_i\\) \\(s_i\\) and \\(h_i\\), intercept should be 0 Comparison of actual returns of US stocks to returns by CAPM and FF showed that FF does a better job of predicting the returns 9.3.4 Risk Based interpretations Liew &amp;

Zhang: Similar test above using conditional CAPM (\\(\\beta\\) and risk premium vary and co-vary over time) Relationship between \\(\\beta\\) and \\(R_M\\) Value firms typically have larger amounts of tangible capital \\(\\Rightarrow\\) More exposed to the risk of economic downturn due to investment irreversibility as they will suffer from XS capacity \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Higher \\(\\beta\\) during down markets Evidence also show market risk premium \\(R_M\\) is higher during down markets \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) (+) correlation between \\(\\beta\\) and \\(R_M\\) for higher B:M value firms Try to prove the above by fitting \\(\\beta\\) and \\(R_M\\) to state variables that summarize the state of the economy \\(DIV\\): Market dividend yield \\(DEFLT\\): Default spread on corporate bonds \\(TERM\\): Term structure spread \\(TB\\): 1 month t bill rate \\(\\begin{array}{cccc} R_{HML} &amp;= \\alpha + &amp;\\beta &amp;R_{Mt} + e \\\\ &amp;= \\alpha + &amp;\\underbrace{[b_0 + b_1 DIV_t + b_2 DEFLT_t + b_3 TERM_t + b_4 TB_t]}_{\\text{time varying }\\beta} &amp;R_{Mt} + e_i \\\\ \\end{array}\\) Equation to tie the market risk premium to the state variables \\(r_{Mt,t} - r_{ft} = c_0 + c_1 DIV_t + c_2 DEFLT_t + c_3 TERM_t + c_4 TB_t + e_t\\) Results showed that \\(\\beta\\) is counter cyclical, negative in good economies and positive during down markets Test indicated that the value factor may indeed be a proxy for risks not fully captured by the standard CAPM \\(\\beta\\) 9.3.5 Behavioral Explanations Value premium arises due to market irrationality Analysts extrapolate the performance too far into the future \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Overestimate the value of firms with recent good performance \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Prices fall when market realizes its mistakes \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Glamour firms will often under perform value firms Glamor firms = those with recent good performance, high prices and lower B:M ratios Studies below support the view of market irrationality Overreaction study (Chan, Karceski and Lakonishok) Groups firms into deciles based on income growth for the past 10 years Measured B:M value at the beginning and end of 5 years period and found: Ending B:M falls steadily with growth \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Past growth has therefore been extrapolated and incorporated into the price Beginning B:M has minimal (small positive) relationship with growth \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Glamour firms do not outperform other firms in terms of future income growth Performance of value vs glamour stocks (La Porta, Lakonishok, Shleifer &amp; Vishny) Focused on the stock price performance of each type once earnings were released Found that value stocks consistently outperform glamour stocks Could be due to market being disappointed by the earnings releases of growth stocks because the expectations were too high 9.3.6 Momentum Momentum has been proposed to be included in the Fama French model as a 4th factor This may be what was causing the \\(\\alpha\\) in the 3 factor model However it is difficult to justify/ explain this factor and unclear to see what type of risk this would be acting as a proxy for 9.4 Liquidity and Asset Pricing Liquidity’s impacts on asset’s \\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) Transaction costs (bid/ask spread) Liquidity risk (\\(\\Delta\\) in liquidity cost) Difficult to estimate as they are often unobservable Characteristics of Liquidity Trading costs Ease of sale Price concessions required to motivate a quick transaction Market depth Price predictability \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Difficult to have a single statistic to capture all the above components Common methods to measure liquidity focus on the price impact: Price reversals follow large trades: Based on the assumption that reversals on the following day would be a symptom of price impact of the initial trade \\(ILLIQ = \\text{M-thly Avg of Daily}\\left[ \\dfrac{\\mid Return_{stock}\\mid}{\\text{Dollar Volume}} \\right]\\) Focus on the relationship between large trades and price movements Measures the price impact per dollar of transactions Measures both liquidity cost and liquidity risk Asymmetric information: Based on the assumption that the price impact is due to asymmetric information Regressions are used to determine how much of the price impact is due to information Liquidity risk will be cause by changes in the prevalence of informationally motivated trades Use one of the above 2 method to derive the level of market wide illiquidity \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Calculate liquidity beta (sensitivity of returns to \\(\\Delta\\) liquidity) of an individual stock If stocks with higher liquidity \\(\\beta\\) have higher returns \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Liquidity is a priced factor Pistor &amp; Stambaugh study: Examine whether liquidity risk is a priced factor Sorted sample portfolio into deciles, based on the liquidity \\(\\beta\\) Calculate the average \\(\\beta\\) of each decile using a model that ignores liquidity (standard CAPM and FF 3 factor) Found that \\(\\alpha\\) did rise substantially for the higher liquidity \\(\\beta\\) deciles \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Supported the view that liquidity risk was a priced factor 9.5 Equity Premium Puzzle Equity premium puzzle: Historical XS returns on risky assets in the US are too large to be consistent with economic theory and reasonable levels of risk aversion 9.5.1 Consumption Growth &amp; Market Rates of Return ICAPM implies that investors make decisions based on their lifetime flow of consumption and not just their current wealth To measure consumer well being we should focus on the consumption flow that wealth can support CAPM \\(\\beta = \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_M)}{\\sigma^2_M}\\), based on the covariance of returns with market return \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Only focused on just wealth Should rely on covariance of the market with aggregate consumption: \\(\\operatorname{E}[r_M] - r_f = A \\cdot \\operatorname{Cov}(r_M, r_C)\\) \\(A\\): Average coefficient of risk aversion \\(r_C\\): Rate of return on a consumption tracking portfolio that has been designed to have the highest possible correlation with growth in aggregate consumption Based on reasonable values of \\(A\\), covariance is much too low to produce the empirical average XS returns \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Given an appropriate risk aversion factor, XS returns are too high Study to demonstrate that the Fama French factors are associated with consumption \\(\\beta\\) (Jagannathan &amp; Wang) High B:M stocks generally have higher consumption \\(\\beta\\)s Larger firms generally have lower \\(\\beta\\)s \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Explanatory powers of the FF factors may be due to consumption risk Also proved that CCAPM model explains returns better than the FF model Standard CCAPM focuses on an average investor \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Does not acknowledge the heterogeneous investor with different level of wealth and consumption habits Newer models reflect the different types of investors e.g. incorporate the fact that the covariance between market returns and consumption \\(\\uparrow\\) when household holds financial securities \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Reflecting the heterogeneity may mitigate the observed equity premium puzzle 9.5.2 Expected vs Realized Returns Historical returns of the S&amp;P 500 relative to the \\(r_f\\) \\(\\upuparrows\\) since 1950s Using average realized returns to derive the risk premium may be the problem causing the puzzle Calculate \\(\\operatorname{E}[r]\\) using dividend discount model \\(\\operatorname{E}[r] = \\dfrac{D_1}{P_0} + g\\) \\(D_1\\) = end of year dividend \\(P_0\\) = current stock price \\(g\\) = expected dividend growth rate Model produced a smaller risk premium than actual for the period after 1950 \\(\\Rightarrow\\) High XS returns for the period may have been &gt; than the rate that investors expected to earn \\(\\hookrightarrow\\) Unanticipated gains may be responsible for the equity premium puzzle 9.5.3 Survivorship Bias Equity premium puzzle is based on studies of US stock return May be caused by survivor-ship bias as the US market has experienced some of the highest returns during the historical period 9.5.4 CAPM Extensions CAPM extensions may resolve the equity premium puzzle Can modify the basic CAPM to account for the observed XS returns by relaxing some of the standard CAPM assumptions Consumers face income shocks (loss of job), the risk of which increases during economic downturns Investors stage in the life cycle has an impact on their situation e.g. borrowing constraints change over time, younger people will typically face more borrowing constraints Study showed that afters accounting for these and other factors, we can explain the higher risk premium observed in the market 9.5.5 Behavioral Explanations Puzzle may arise due to irrational investor behavior Narrow framing Investors evaluate each risk that they are exposed to in isolation \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Ignore the fact that risk from the stock portfolio has a low correlation with other components of wealth \\(\\Rightarrow\\) Require a higher risk premium than indicated by the models Loss aversion This will also cause investors to require higher premiums 9.6 Past Exam Questions "]
