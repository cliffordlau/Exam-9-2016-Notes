9.png)\n\n**SML vs CML**\n\n* CML: Risk premium of *efficient Portfolios* vs $\\sigma$\n\n    * $\\sigma$ is the appropriate risk measure for portfolios\n  \n* SML: Risk premium of *individual asseets* vs $\\beta$\n\n    * $\\beta$ is the appropriate risk measure for individual securities held as part of a well diversified portfolio\n    \n### Testing CAPM\n\nImpossible to construct market portfolio, so test the SML equation instead $\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_i R_M$\n\nRegression on the XS returns of a sample of stocks against their betas over time\n\n$R_{i,t} = \\lambda_0 + \\lambda_1 \\beta_i + \\lambda_2 \\sigma^2(e_i) + \\eta_{i,t}$\n\nCAPM predicts:\n\n* $\\lambda_0 = 0$ as the average $\\alpha = 0$\n\n* $\\lambda_1 = R_M$ as the slope of SML = market risk premium\n\n* $\\lambda_2 = 0$ as the risk premium is only based on proportion of market risk premium\n\nEstimate the $\\beta$ and residual variance for each stock from time series of stock return\n\n**Caveat**\n\n* Parameter estimates have large errors and may be correlated $\\Rightarrow$ Downward bias in $\\lambda_1$ and upward bias on $\\lambda_0$\n\n* Might reject CAPM even if it is valid\n\n    * Returns simulated following CAPM but regression still indicates that CAPM does not hold\n    \n* Parameters are time varying but the regression techniques does not recognize this\n\n## CAPM Extensions\n\nProblematic assumptions:\n\n* No restrictions on short sales, but in reality it can be difficult to take short positions\n\n* All assets are tradable\n\n* No transaction costs\n\n* Single period horizon\n\nHowever the extensions of CAPM are not perfect so none have superseded CAPM so far\n\n### Zero Beta CAPM\n\nWhen investors face borrowing restrictions of risk free asset\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[r_i] = \\operatorname{E}[r_Z] + \\beta_i \\left[\\operatorname{E}[r_M] - \\operatorname{E}[r_Z]\\right]$\n\n* $Z$ =  zero-beta portfolio for M\n\n* Uncorrelated portfolio on the inefficient side of the minimum-variance frontier\n\nInvestors with borrowing restrictions will invest more in high $\\beta$ stocks and less in low $\\beta$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\uparrow$ price of high $\\beta$ stocks\n\n* $SML_{zb} < SML_{reg}$\n\n* Risk premium on the market portfolio is smaller as the $\\operatorname{E}[r_Z] > r_f$ so less reward for bearing risk\n\n### Non-Traded Assets\n\nSome assets are tradable e.g. human capital and privately held business\n\n* These are of significant values and can have a material impact on the equilibrium returns of traded securities\n\n**Privately held business**\n\n* Privately held business w/ similar characteristics to traded assets:  \nLittle impact to CAPM as owners can still achieve diversification by reducing their portfolio of other similar traded assets $\\Rightarrow$ Still holding market portfolio\n\n* Privately held business w/o similar characteristics to traded assets:  \nPortfolio of traded assets that hedge the private business will be up $Rightarrow$ $\\downarrow$ expected return $\\Rightarrow$ $-\\alpha$ in traditional CAPM\n\n**Human Capital**\n\n* Only way to hedge is for employees to avoid purchasing share of their own employer $\\Rightarrow$ labor intensive firms will have lower demand $\\Rightarrow$ $+\\alpha$ in traditional CAPM\n\n* Adjusted CAPM for labor income:\n\n    * $\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\operatorname{E}[R_M] \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_M) + \\frac{P_H}{P_M}\\operatorname{Cov}(R_i, R_H)}{\\sigma^2_M + \\frac{P_H}{P_M}\\operatorname{Cov}(R_M,R_H)}$\n    \n    * $P_H$: value of aggregate human capital\n    \n    * $P_M$: market value of traded assets\n    \n* Adjustment produce lower $\\beta$ so a SML with a less steep slope, which explain negative alpha of high beta securities indicated by some tests\n\n### Multiperiod CAPM\n\n**Intertemporal CAPM**\n\nAssume investors will optimize their consumption/ investment over their lifetime\n\nICAPM = CAPM when:\n\n* Only type of risk is the uncertainty about portfolio returns\n\n* Investment opportunities are constant over time\n\nHowever, over the long run we expect additional sources of risk to arise and **hedge portfolios** will be bid up\n\n1) Changes in the parameters that describe investment opportunities\n\n    * Investors will bid up prices of assets that have higher return during periods of adverse economic environment $\\Rightarrow$ lower expected return\n    \n2) Changes in the prices of consumption goods\n\n    * Investors will bid up prices of assets that hedge the increases in prices of consumption goods (inflation protection)\n    \nICAPM with $K$ sources of extramarket risk and $K$ hedge portfolios:\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_{iM}\\operatorname[R_M] + \\sum_k \\beta_{ik}\\operatorname[R_k]$\n\n* $\\beta_{ik}$ is the $\\beta$ on the $k$^th^ hedge portfolio\n\n### Consumption Based CAPM\n\nAssume that in a period, investors need to allocate the current wealth between consumption today and savings/ investments to support future consumption\n\nOptimal mix: utility from an additional dollar of consumption today = utility associated with the future consumption generated from the investment of that dollar\n\n* Additional income from savings are more valued during tough economic times (w/ limited consumption opportunities) $\\Rightarrow$ Assets with (+) covariance with consumption growth (higher payoff when consumption is already high) are viewed as riskier $\\Rightarrow$ Risk premium higher\n\nCCAPM:\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[R_i] = \\beta_{iC}RP_C$\n\n* $C$ is a consumption tracking portfolio, one with the highest correlation with consumption growth\n\n* $\\beta$ of market portfolio can be > 1\n\nDisadvantages: consumption growth figures are published infrequently and with significant error\n\n### Liquidity Adjusted CAPM\n\nSecurity prices should be discounted to reflect illiquidity\n\n* Standard CAPM ignores liquidity costs like bid-ask spread\n\n* Discount $\\uparrow$ as trading cost $\\uparrow$ but *not* proportional to the increase due to **clientele effect**\n\n    * Frequent traders hold more liquid assets and long term traders hold less liquid assets\n    \nInvestor also demand additional return on liquidity risk (risk of unanticipated changes in liquidity)\n\n* Can be adjusted with liquidity $\\beta$ that reflects the sensitivity of the return of the security to changes in market liquidity",
