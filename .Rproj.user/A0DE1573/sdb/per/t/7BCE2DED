\\operatorname{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}{\\sigma^2_E + \\sigma^2_D - 2\\cdot\\operatorname{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}$\n\n$w_E^{Min} = 1 - w_D^{Min}$\n\n**Portfolio Opportunity Set** for a given $\\rho$\n\n![alt text](figures/Exam 9 -

\\operatorname{E}[R_E] \\operatorname{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}{\\operatorname{E}[R_D]\\sigma^2_E + \\operatorname{E}[R_E]\\sigma^2_D - \\left( \\operatorname{E}[R_D] + \\operatorname{E}[R_E] \\right) \\operatorname{Cov}(r_D, r_E)}$\n\n* $R_D = r_D - r_f$ = XS return over risk free\n\n**Optimal Complete Portfolio**\n\nWeights between $r_f$ and risky portfolio P depends on investors risk aversion $A$ as per BKM 6\n\n![alt text](figures/Exam 9 - 7.png)\n\n## Markowitz Portfolio Selection Model\n\n![alt text](figures/Exam 9 - 8.png)\n\n**Minimum-variance Frontier**  \nMade up of dominant portfolios\n\n* Portfolios with the lowest variance for each level of expected return\n\n**Global Minimum-variance porfolio**  \nPortfolio with the lowest variance\n\n**Efficient Frontier**  \nPortion of the minimum-variance frontier above the global minimum-variance portfolio\n\n***\n\nExpected return and variance of the optimal complete portfolio\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[r_p] = \\sum_i w_i \\operatorname{E}[r_i]$\n\n$\\sigma^2_p = \\sum_i \\sum_j w_i w_j \\operatorname{Cov}(r_i, r_j)$\n\n## Separation Principle\n\nOptimal risky portfolio P is the same for all investors\n\nDifference between investors is the portion of the complete portfolio in the risky portfolio vs risk free asset driven by investor's risk aversion $A$\n\n2 steps in portfolio selection under **separation principle**:\n\n1) Select optimal risky portfolio\n\n* This only differs depending on the analyst\n\n* CAL is the same for all investors\n\n2) Select the optimal complete portfolio\n\n* Allocate between risk free vs risky assets depending on investors $A$\n\n* Investor's $A$ dictates where the optimal complete portfolio lies on the CAL\n\n## Asset Allocation vs Security Selection\n\nSo far focused has been on *asset allocation*\n\n* Allocation of a complete portfolio to the various asset categories\n\nStep 1: Asset allocation\n\n* Figure out how much to allocate to each asset class\n\nStep 2: Security selection\n\n* Select specific securities in order to try increase return\n\nProcedure of optimal security selection is the same as the procedure of optimal asset allocation in the above sections\n\nSince it's impossible to be expert in all securities from all asset class, after allocating money to the different asset classes, consult expert for the security selection in each class\n\n## Risk Pooling vs Risk Sharing {.tabset}\n\n### Risk Pooling\n\n**Risk pooling** involves merging several uncorrelated projects together, aka the **insurance principle**\n\n* Does not reduce risk\n\n* Increases the total exposure to risk\n\n* As investor increase the risk pooling to include $n$ assets, both the Sharpe ratio and $\\sigma$ will increase by $n^{0.5}$ for asset with the same $R$ and $\\sigma$ that is uncorrelated with each other\n\n### Risk Sharing\n\n**Risk sharing** involves taking a fixed amount of risk and sharing it among several investors\n\n* Increase Sharpe ratio without increase the exposure\n\nPractical perspective:\n\n* Reduce risk by selling share of the insurer to investors\n\n* Assuming that the total risk per investor remains constant, Sharpe ratio will increase as the # of policies written increases\n\nCaveat: \n\n* Disadvantages of managing a very large firm and will put pressure on the profit margin\n\n* Impact of any error when estimating the risk of the insured will be compounded over many policies\n\n## Investment for the Long Run\n\n**Time diversification** is not true and does not reduce risk\n\n* Extending investment horizon for an additional period is similar to adding additional risky asset\n\n* Similar to risk pooling\n\n* To increase Sharpe ratio while maintaining the same level of risk, investor needs to half the investment if double the time horizon",
