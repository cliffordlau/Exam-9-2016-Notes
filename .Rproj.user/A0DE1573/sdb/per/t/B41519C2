L \\cdots (1)$\n\n* Investor only contributes $A$ at t=0\n* Both premium and assets are invested\n* Inflow @ t=1: $F(1+r_f)$\n* Outflow @ t=1: $L$\n* Get back surplus and premium with investment income net of losses\n\nThe expected value of the above and assuming IRR = target investment yield:  \n$(1 + y)A = F(1+r_f) -

\\mu_L}{1+y}}_{A} \\dfrac{y - r_f}{1+r_f}$\n\n#### Investment Variance Constraint\n\n$\\sigma_{IRR} = \\sigma_L$\n\n* By taking s.d. on both side of $(1)$\n\n$A \\geq \\dfrac{\\sigma_L}{\\sigma_y}$\n\n* Since variance of the IRR must be $\\leq$ variance of the target investment\n\n$R = \\underbrace{\\dfrac{\\sigma_L}{\\sigma_y}}_{A} \\dfrac{y - r_f}{1+r_f}$\n\n### Technique 2: Put options\n\nReinsurer invests the funds in the target investment then purchases a put option with strike price that yields risk free return (before recognizing the cost of the option)\n\n* Cost of the option\n* Increased return and reduction in variance\n\n***\n\nShareholder IRR:  \n$(1 + IRR)A = \\underbrace{\\dfrac{P+A}{1+r}}_{F}(1+I) - L \\cdots (3)$\n\n* Similar to technique 1 expect investment yield is $I$ and $F$ is different\n* Fund invested is decreased by the cost of put option\n\nThe expected value of the above and assuming IRR = target investment yield:  \n$(1 + y)A = F(1+i) -

\\sigma_i^2(1+y)^2$\n\n* $b = \\mu_L(1+y)\\sigma_i^2$\n\n* $c = \\mu_L^2 \\sigma_i^2 + \\sigma_L^2 (1+i)^2$\n\n$R = A \\dfrac{(1+r)(1+y) - (1+i)}{1+i} + \\mu_L \\left[ \\dfrac{1+r}{1+i} - \\dfrac{1}{1+r_f} \\right]$\n\n* Same as technique 1 if $i = r_f$, $r=0$ and $\\sigma_i = 0$\n\n## Calculating the Risk Load\n\nProcedure:\n\n1) Pick the more restrictive constraint from each technique\n\n    * The constraints are minimum standard $\\Rightarrow$ Pick the higher of the 2 constraint\n    * Don't need to calculate the risk load at this step as it is based on the $A$\n    \n2) Pick risk load between the 2 technique\n\n    * Lower risk load $\\Rightarrow$ More competitive\n    * Higher risk load $\\Rightarrow$ Greater profit (if market accept)\n    \n## Adjustments to the Scenario\n\nAdjustments to some of the assumptions used in the model\n\n### Single Payment at Arbitrary Time\n\nFormula needs to change in the loss payment can occurs at arbitrary time $t$ instead of end of the year\n\nNeed to annualized the returns e.g. $(1+i)$ $\\rightarrow$ $(1+i)^t$\n\nOption rate and $\\sigma$ will also change to reflect the loss payments at different times\n\n### High XS Layer and Minimum Premium\n\nConsider situations where:\n\n* High XS layer, or\n* Any finite rate event\n\nKreps showed that there is a non zero rate on line ($\\dfrac{\\text{Premium}}{\\text{Limit}}$) despite the very low probability of loss\n\n**Assumptions**\n\n* Loss dist^n^ $\\sim$ Binomial with probability $p$ hitting the layer\n* It loss does hit the layer it is total loss\n\nSafety limit $s$ = limit of the layer\n\nConsider $\\lim \\limits_{p \\rightarrow 0}$ for rare losses\n\n$\\lim \\limits_{p \\rightarrow 0} \\mu_L = \\lim \\limits_{p \\rightarrow 0} ps = 0$\n\n**Option technique**\n\n$R = \\dfrac{s[(1+y)(1+r)-(1+i)]}{(1+r_f)(1+y)}$\n\n$ROL = \\dfrac{[(1+y)(1+r)-(1+i)]}{(1+r_f)(1+y)}$\n\n**Swap technique**\n\n$ROL = \\dfrac{y-r_f}{(1+r_f)(1+y)}$\n\n* Based on above with $i = r_f$ and $r=0$\n\n***\n\nBoth are (+) numbers $\\Rightarrow$ as $\\lim \\limits_{p \\rightarrow 0} ROL > 0$\n\nIn the market, the minimum $ROL$ is justified by underwriters as a charge for using surplus\n\nOur method supports the view and also with a quantification of the charge\n\n## Pooling\n\nRisk load can be reduced by pooling since contracts are not fully correlated $\\Rightarrow$ $s$ < $\\sum s_i$ as it will be very rare for all the risks insured to have tail losses\n\n$\\therefore$ Reinsurer should not use the above to price, unless:\n\n* Desires to be very conservative, or\n* That is the only contract being priced\n\n## Simplifications\n\nLosses were assumed to occur at year end\n\n* Easy to modify for losses that occur at other points in time\n\nIgnored the spot rates for the risk free investment depends on the length of time being considered\n\n* Easy to modify\n\nIn multi year examples, it may be possible to recognize a degree of correlation between the various years since they are from the same firm/ exposures\n\nPricing method in this paper biased high as it assume each risk is standalone\n\n* More accurate would be to consider the risk load of the whole book with and without the proposed contract\n\n## Past Exam Questions",
