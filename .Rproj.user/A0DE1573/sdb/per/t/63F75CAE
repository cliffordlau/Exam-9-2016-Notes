expected\n\n#### Multifactor SML\n\nCalculate the risk premiums for the risk factors with a **factor portfolio**\n\n* Portfolio that have $\\beta = 1$ for which the risk premium is being measured, else $\\beta = 0$\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[r_i] = r_f + \\sum \\limits_{j=1}^n \\beta_{ij} \\left( \\operatorname{E}[r_j] -r_f \\right)$ <span style=\"color:red\">Where is this from?</span>\n\n### Fama French Three Factor Model\n\nUses firm characteristics that seem to be proxy for exposure to systematic risk\n\n$R_{it} = \\alpha_i + \\beta_{iM}R_{Mt} + \\beta_{iSMB}SMB_t + \\beta_{iHML}HML_t + e_{it}$\n\n* $SMB$ = return of a portfolio of small stocks in XS of portfolio of large stocks\n\n* $HML$ = return of a portfolio of high $\\frac{\\text{book}}{\\text{market}}$ in XS of portfolio of low $\\frac{\\text{book}}{\\text{market}}$ stocks\n\n* Include market index as well to include systematic risk from macroeconomic factors\n\nThe 2 additional factors maybe acting as proxies for something fundamental\n\nProblem with FF model is that it is derived from empirical evidence, and none of the factors can be identified as hedging a specific source of uncertainty\n\n* Pattern might be purely due to chance\n\n## Arbitrage Pricing Theory\n\n**Arbitrage**:  \nOpportunity to earn 1) risk-less profit 2) without need to make a net investment\n\n**Law of one price**:  \nTwo assets with equivalent economical aspects should have the same market price\n\n**APT Assumptions**:\n\n1) Security returns can be described by a factor model\n\n2) There are a sufficient number of securities to diversify away idiosyncratic risk\n\n3) Well functioning securities markets do not allow for persistence of arbitrage opportunities\n\n### Equilibrium\n\nMarket prices change to eliminate arbitrage opportunities and reach equilibrium when the opportunity disappears\n\n**Risk return dominance**  \nMany investors will make limited changes to their portfolio (depending on risk aversion) and the cumulative changes from sufficient volumes move the market price\n\n**Arbitrage**  \nInvestor who discovers the arbitrage will maximize his position to maximize profits so lower number of investors are needed to move prices back to equilibrium\n\n### Impact of Diversification\n\nReturn of portfolio with $n$ stocks using single factor model\n$r_p = \\operatorname{E}[r_p] + \\beta_p F + e_p$\n\n$\\sigma^2(e_p) = \\dfrac{\\sigma^2(e_i)}{n}$ $\\Rightarrow$ $\\underbrace{\\lim \\limits_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} \\sigma^2(e_p) = 0}_{\\text{diversification}}$\n\n$\\hookrightarrow$ After diversification $r_p = \\operatorname{E}[r_p] + \\beta_p F$ as the non factor risk can be diversified away and security will only receive risk premium for the factor risk\n\n![alt text](figures/Exam 9 - 10.png)\n\n### Executing Arbitrage\n\nGiven 2 well diversified portfolio $M$ and $P$ that has (+) $\\alpha$\n\nConstruct $Z$ a zero beta portfolio with $M$ and $P$\n\n$\\beta_Z = \\w_p \\beta_p + (1-w_p)\\beta_M = 0$ $Rightarrow$ $w_p = \\dfrac{1}{1-\\beta_p}$\n\n$\\hookrightarrow$ $Z$ is riskless since no residual risk from diversification and 0 systematic risk from $\\beta$\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[R_z] = \\alpha_Z = w_p \\alpha_p = \\dfrac{\\alpha_p}{1 - \\beta_p}$\n\n* If $\\beta_p < 1$, borrow money and invest in $Z$ to make a risk free profit\n\n* If $\\beta_p > 1$, short $Z$ and invest in risk free\n\n### No-Arbitrage Equation\n\nReturn of well diversified portfolio with APT $\\operatorname{E}[R_p] = \\alpha_p \\beta_p \\operatorname{E}[R_M]$\n\n$\\Downarrow$ No arbitrage, $\\alpha = 0$\n\nAPT SML: $\\operatorname{E}[R_p] = \\beta_p \\operatorname{E}[R_M]$\n\n* Same as CAPM SML\n\nFor APT, there can not be 2 parallel APT SML as that would mean one to be dominant over the other and investor can produce arbitrage opportunity\n\n### APT vs CAPM\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* Based on diversified portfolio $\\Rightarrow$ 0 residual risk\n\n* If residual risk is sufficiently high, cannot have full confidence in APT\n\nAdvantages:\n\n* Does not reply on mean-variance optimizers assumption\n\n* Does not require an all inclusive portfolio\n\n### Optimizatio in a Single Index Market\n\nAPT indicates how to generate infinite profit if risk premium of well diversified portfolio differs from the SML\n\n* If arbitrage portfolio not perfectly well diversified, increasing the size of an investment to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity will also increase the risk of the arbitrage position\n\n**Treynor-Black Model**\n\nTo construct an optimal risky portfolio based on identified underpriced asset or portfolio under a single factor market\n\n* Model produces an optimal risky portfolio if there is residual risk\n\n* More flexible that APT in reflecting residual risk that may exist",
