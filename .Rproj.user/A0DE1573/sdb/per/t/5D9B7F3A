investment income on surplus; all of the investment income from policy cash flow\n    * ROE vs ROS\n* 2007, Q21 a: State of the market\n* 2008, Q19: ROE issues on rate regulation; ROS advantages\n* 2012, Q16: ROE ROS comparison with some calc\n* $\\star$ 2015, Q22: ROE ROS with some new twist and additional considerations\n\n## Profitablity vs Rate of Return\n\n**Profit**\n\nAbsolute number\n\nInvestors and management are interested in profit\n\nDifficult to compare\n\n**Rate of Return**\n\nProfit as a % of:\n\n* Equity\n* Assets\n* Sales\n\nMeasure of efficiency\n\nUse for comparison\n\n**Regulation**\n\nRegulators focus on rate of return\n\nRate regulation is prospective\n\nIf applied retrospectively, be aware that a single year of experience is not sufficient to assess the true profitability of the business\n\n## Opportunity Cost\n\nPolicyholders are losing out on some investment income as premiums are paid up front\n\n<a name=\"opp-cost-fac\"></a>\n\nFactors that affect opportunity cost:\n\n1) **LoB**: Opportunity cost is greater for LoBs with longer tail\n2) Cash needed to support the **infrastructure** of the insurer\n\n    * This cash is not invested and is tied up in infrastructure\n    * Most are provided by prior policyholders and the current insureds are benefiting from them\n    * Policyholders should not receive credit for the investment income from the money invested in infrastructure\n    \nOpportunity cost should be discounted at **risk free**\n\n* Policyholder is not exposed to any of the risk of the investment\n* Policyholders do not have to provide for the shortfall even if the insurer's investment lose money\n\n***\n\nTotal Surplus = Policyholder Funds + Shareholder Funds\n\n* Investment income is earned on the total surplus\n* Investment income needs to be segmented between the 2 types of funds\n\nPremium credit should only be given for the investment income of policyholders fund\n\n* Surplus is not owned by the p/h\n* Including surplus will penalize high surplus insurers as they will need to charge lower premiums\n\n***\n\nCalculation:\n\n1) Determine net cash flow (Premium - Loss - Expense) over the whole time horizon\n2) Discount with risk free rate\n\n## ROE vs ROS\n\nReturn on equity vs return on sales (premium)\n\nROE compares the profit of the insurer to the owner's investment\n\n### Problems of ROE\n\n<a name=\"roe-prob\"></a> **ROE vs Rate Equity**\n\nProblem of focusing on ROE in rate regulation is that this forces the regulator to focus on ROE instead of rate equity\n\nROE can be distorted by the leverage ($\\dfrac{\\text{Premium}}{\\text{Surplus}}$) of the insurer $\\Rightarrow$ Concept of rate equity may not apply\n\n* $\\uparrow$ Surplus $\\Rightarrow$ $\\uparrow$ ROE\n\n**Surplus Allocation**\n\nSurplus allocation is artificial\n\nSurplus allocation ignores the value of unallocated surplus\n\n* e.g. 100M PHS company with 1M allocated vs 1M PHS company\n\n**ROS is Simpler**\n\nIf surplus is allocated based on target P:S ratio, it would be more direct to regulate ROS directly\n\n### ROS\n\nRegulating ROS specifies an adequate profit margin as % of premium\n\n* Similar to the concept of markup\n\nROS means a lot more to consumer than ROE\n\nROS is a true rate regulation because it does not depend on the relationship between premium and equity\n\n## Profitability Standards\n\nInsurer needs to charge an adequate rate of return that provides a margin of safety\n\n* u/w profit provision needs to provide for an appropriate after tax return\n\nIf rates are inadequate $\\Rightarrow$ Tighten u/w standards $\\Rightarrow$ Reduce current volume\n\n$\\therefore$ Regulators can judge if the current rate of return is appropriate by examining the structure of the industry\n\nSigns of inadequate return:\n\n* Increasing size of residual market\n* Reducing degree of product diversity\n* Reduced innovation\n\n## Uncertainty of Profitability\n\nLost of uncertainty in the estimation of losses for insurers\n\nManagement can influence the results by tempering with reserve\n\n* Weaken reserves in poor year to reduce the size of u/w loss\n* Strengthen reserves in a good year to provide some cushion for future years\n\nCurrent u/w results will be affected by\n\n* Current reserve decisions\n* Amortization of past reserving decisions\n\n$\\therefore$ difficult for analyst examining the financials to determine how they really are performing in a given year\n\n## Past Exam Problems\n\nn/a",
