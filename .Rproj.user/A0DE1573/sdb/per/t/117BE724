Not all are econ capital)\n\nShould consider multiple risk measures to see if the results are consistent\n\n* Many other risk measures will also have the properties above\n* Calling one of the risk measures economic capital is likely to confuse the process\n    * (I guess econ capital is just a generic term?)\n    \nCurrent modeling approaches are not able to accurately estimate losses deep in the tail like 1-in-3000 (99.97%) event\n\n* Bond ratings are discusses at this level but the ratings are not tied to the probabilities; Probabilities were simply observed\n\n* Issue can be circumvented by focusing on events that can lead to impairment of the company, not just insolvency\n\nChoosing probability level is an artificial exercise $\\because$ There are no theoretical support to choose one level over another\n\n* The company sometimes compare held capital to the loss dist^n^ stating that it's holding capital to cover a 1-in-x year event. But not the other way around like setting the capital based on it\n\nCompany is better off expressing the capital under various risk measures\n\n## Risk Measures\n\n3 major class of risk measures\n* Moment-based (e.g. mean, variance)\n* Tail-based (VaR, TVaR)\n* Probability Transformation (WTVaR, Mean of Transformed dist^n^)\n\nRisk measure can measure losses (like from insurance) but mostly mean negative profit (including premium charged) here\n\n* $Y =$ Losses\n* $\\rho(Y) =$ Risk Measure\n\n### Moment-Based Measures\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[Y^k]$ is the k^th^ moment of $Y$ which represent losses\n\n* 1^st^ moment = Mean\n* 2^nd^ central moment = Variance = $\\operatorname{E}[(Y-\\operatorname{E}[Y])^2]$\n    * S.d. is preferred as it has the same units as the loss\n* 3^rd^ moment = Skewness\n\n$\\operatorname{E}[Y e^{cY/\\operatorname{E}[Y]}]$ captures all the moment using taylor expansion\n\n* Does not exist unless there is a maximum possible loss\n\n### Tail-Based Measures at $\\alpha$ Percentile\n\n| Risk Measure | Name                | Description                            |\n| ------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |\n| $VaR$        | Value at Risk       | $\\alpha$^th^ Percentile                |\n| $TVaR$       | Tail Value at Risk  | Avg loss above $\\alpha$^th^ percentile |\n| $XTVaR$      | XS Tail Value at Risk | $TVaR - Mean$                        |\n| $EPD$        | Expected Policyholder Deficit | $(TVaR - VaR) \\cdot (1 - \\alpha)$ |\n| Value of Default Put Option |      | Market cost of insuring for losses over $VaR_{\\alpha}$|\n\n* $XTVaR$ focuses on funding losses above the mean\n* $EPD$ = unconditional expected value of defaulted losses if Capital = $VaR_{\\alpha}$\n    * If there was no risk premium required, this is the cost of insuring for losses over $VaR_{\\alpha}$\n* Value of default put is great than EPD, it includes an additional risk premium\n\n### Probability Transforms\n\nTo recognize that large losses are worse for the firm in more than a linear way (e.g. losses twice as big is > twice as worst)\n\nChange the loss distribution function by putting more weight (add probability) to the worst losses\n\n* e.g. Esscher transform $f^*(y) = k \\cdot e ^{y/c} \\: f(y)$\n    * Lower $c$ $\\Rightarrow$ Higher losses from the transformed dist^n^\n    * Can get non sensical results for $c$ that's too low\n* $EPD$ on a transformed dist^n^ can give us the value of the default put\n\nComments\n\n* Most asset pricing formulas like CAPM and Black-Scholes can be expressed as transformed means $\\therefore$ transformed means are a promising risk measure for determining the market value of risk as it can also be the market value of the risk\n\n* Complete market is where any risk can be sold, but we work in incomplete markets\n\n* Theory of pricing in incomplete markets favors:\n\n    * Minimum Martingale Transform (MMT)\n    * Minimum Entropy Martingale Transform (MET)\n    * These give reasonable approximations of reinsurance prices\n    \n* Mean under then Wang transform closely approximates market prices for bonds and CAT bonds\n\n* $WTVaT$ is $TVaR$ on a transformed distribution\n\n### Generalized Moments\n\nInclude more than just $\\operatorname{E}[Y^k]$\n\n$TVaR_{\\alpha} = \\operatorname{E} \\left[ Y \\cdot \\left( Y > F^{ -1}(\\alpha) \\right) \\mid Y > F^{ -1}(\\alpha) \\right]$\n\n* $(Y > b) = \\begin{cases} 1 & : Y > b\\\\ 0 & : \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}$\n\n* Average of $Y$ when $Y$ > than the $\\alpha^{th}$ percentile: $F^{ -1}(\\alpha)$\n\n**Spectral Measures**\n\n$\\rho(Y) = \\operatorname{E} \\left[ Y \\cdot \\eta \\left( F(Y) \\right) \\right]$\n\n* $\\eta \\geq 0$\n\n* Multiply the loss by a non-negative scalar $\\eta(Y)$ when taking the expectations\n\n**Blurred VaR**\n\n$\\eta(p) = \\operatorname{exp} \\left \\{ - \\theta (p-\\alpha)^2 \\right \\}$\n\n* Give more weight to losses near $\\alpha^{th}$ percentile\n\n* Still using the whole distribution\n\n* $\\theta controls how quickly the weight drops of as we get further from $\\alpha$\n\n***\n\nWhich risk measures to use\n\n* $TVaR$ at a low percentile is fine as it captures all risks above this level; Set at level where we begin to loss capital\n\n* Try to get close to market value of risk\n\n    * $WTVaR$ with the MET is promising, or\n    * Exponential moment $\\operatorname{E}[Y e^{cY/\\operatorname{E}[Y]}]$\n\n## Required Capital\n\nCapital a company should hold depends on *practical considerations*, not simply derived from a risk measure\n\n* Risk measures should be used to measure the safety of the capital\n\nConsiderations that drive capital requirements:\n\n* **Customers** reactions: Well capitalized insurer $\\Leftarrow$ vs $\\Rightarrow$ better price\n\n    * $\\downarrow$ rating $\\Rightarrow$ $\\downdownarrows$ of cumtomers since customers that want a higher level can quickly leave\n\n    * $\\uparrow$ rating $\\Rightarrow$ $\\upharpoonleft$ of growth since higher rating just provides an opportunity to compete with other insurers that already have the business\n\n* **Keeping renewal business**: Have enough capital so that in adverse scenario there is still enough capital to service renewals that is x% of the business\n\n***\n\nOnce capital level has been established, there are risk measures to compare it against\n\n$TVaR$ is a better risk measure than $VaR$ for a given percentile since $VaR$ is just the smallest loss XS of a percentile, $TVaR$ is the average\n\n## Capital Allocation\n\nAllocate the company risk measure to each BU for the following purposes:\n\n* Measure the amount of risk each BU contributes\n\n* Set capacity and policy limits for each BU\n\n* Calculate risk-adjusted profitability e.g. $\\dfrac{\\text{Profit}}{\\text{Allocated Capital}} or EVA = Profit - Cost of Capital\n\n***\n\nDefinition:\n\n$Y$: Losses of a company\n\n$X_j$: Losses for each BU, $\\sum_j X_j = Y$\n\n$\\rho(Y)$: Risk measure of $Y$, $\\mapsto$ a real number\n\n$r(X_j)$: Allocation of risk measure to the individual BUs\n\n* Usually different from $\\rho(X_j)$, which is the risk measure applied to BU $j$\n\n### Proportional Method\n\nAllocate risk measure in proportion to the risk measure applied to each unit\n\n$r(X_j) = \\dfrac{\\rho(X_j)}{\\sum_i \\rho(X_i)} \\rho(Y)$\n\n* $TVaR$: $r(X_j) = \\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) > \\alpha]$; Condition on when the **firm** has losses XS the $\\alpha^{th}$ percentile\n\n* $VaR$: $r(X_j) = \\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) = \\alpha]$; Condition on when the firm has losses at the $\\alpha^{th}$ percentile\n\n    * Difficult to calculate because it is estimating a single point in the dist^n^, results from sims can be quite variable\n\n* Typical you're conditioning on the BU's $\\alpha^{th}$ percentile\n\nNot marginal if the condition is not on the firm's $\\alpha$\n\n* Marginal allocation means as unit grows, it is charged with the additional capital it requires\n\n* Not marginal means the individuals don't sum to the total (?)\n\n### Co-Measures\n\n$r(X_j) = \\operatorname{E}[h(X_j) \\cdot L(Y) \\mid g(Y)]$\n\nGiven that:\n\n* $\\rho(Y) = \\operatorname{E}[h(Y) \\cdot L(Y) \\mid g(Y)]$\n* $h(\\cdot)$ is additive: $h(u+v) = h(u) + h(v)$\n\n$\\hookrightarrow$ $\\rho(Y) = \\sum_j r(X_j)$\n\n* This is a marginal allocation that sums to the total risk measure\n\n| Risk Measure | $h(Y)$ | $L(Y)$ | Condition | Co-Measure |\n| ------------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- |\n| $TVaR$ | $Y$ | $1$ | $F(Y) > \\alpha$ | $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) > \\alpha]$ |\n| $VaR$ | $Y$ | $1$ | $F(Y) = \\alpha$ | $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) = \\alpha]$ |\n| Standard Deviation | $Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y]$ | $\\dfrac{Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y]}{\\sigma_Y}$ | none | $\\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X_j,Y)}{\\sigma_Y}$ |\n| $XTVaR$ |   |   |   | $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid Y > b] - \\operatorname{E}[X_j]$\n\n* Note for S.d.: $\\rho(X_j) = \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X_j,Y)}{\\sigma_Y} = \\operatorname{E} \\left [ (X_j - \\operatorname{E}[X_j]) \\cdot \\dfrac{Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y]}{\\sigma_Y} \\right ]$ \n\n* For $XTVaR$:\n\n    * $\\rho(Y) = \\operatorname{E}[Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y ]\\mid Y > b]$\n    \n    * Note the condition is on loss amount $Y$ not the percentile\n    \n    * Expected losses in unit $j$ when the company has a loss above $b$ less the expected losses in unit $j$\n    \nAt low threshold, unit with higher mean have higher allocation\n\nAt higher threshold, unite with higher variance have higher allocation\n\n### Having a Marginal Method\n\n**Marginal Allocation**:  \nAllocation is marginal if the change to the company's risk measure from a small change in a single BU is attributed to that business unit\n\n* Consistent with concept that price should be proportional to marginal cost\n* Leads to suitable allocation\n\n***\n\n**Scalable Risk Measures**:  \nA small proportional change in the business change the risk measure by the same proportion\n\n* Require that $\\rho(aY) = a \\cdot \\rho(Y)$ $\\Rightarrow$ Homogenous of degree 1\n\n* Most measures in currency units have this property (e.g. S.D. TVaR) but not variance and probability of default\n\nScalability gives us that risk measure is both *marginal* and *additive*\n\nProportional change can be achieve from proportional reinsurance and normal growth\n\n* Except for companies that write large policies compared to their volume; Transformed risk measure might still work\n\n***\n\n**Suitable Allocation**:  \nGrowing a unit that have above average profit/risk will increase the profit/risk for the company\n\nGiven $\\dfrac{P_j}{r(X_j)} > \\dfrac{P}{\\rho(Y)}$\n\nShow $\\dfrac{P + \\epsilon P_j}{\\rho(Y + \\epsilon X_j)} > \\dfrac{P}{\\rho(Y)}$\n\n### Marginal Impact\n\nA risk measure can have many co-measures but only 1 will be marginal\n\nIt is the one that is based on derivative of the firm risk measure w.r.t. growth in BU $j$\n\n$r(X_j) = \\lim \\limits_{\\epsilon \\rightarrow 0} \\dfrac{\\rho(Y + \\epsilon X_j) - \\rho(Y)}{\\epsilon} = \\dfrac{\\partial \\rho(Y)}{\\partial X_j}$\n\n* Even under non-homogeneous growth, the risk measure is still decompositional (sum to the total) and is often close to marginal\n\n$XTVaR$\n\n* Scalable when done XS of a percentile $\\alpha$\n\n* $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) > \\alpha] - \\operatorname{E}[X_j]$\n\nVariance\n\n* $r(X_j) = \\operatorname{Cov}(X_j,Y)$\n\n* Not scalable, so not marginal\n\n$VaR$\n\n* $r(X_j) = \\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) = \\alpha]$\n\nStandard Deviation\n\n* Spreading the s.d. $\\propto$ mean is not marginal: $r(X_j) = \\dfrac{\\operatorname{E}[X_j]}{\\operatorname{E}[Y]} \\cdot \\sigma_Y$\n\n* This is marginal: $r(X_j) = \\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X_j,Y)}{\\sigma_Y}$\n\nExponential Moment\n\n* $r(X_j) = r_1(X_j) + \\dfrac{\\operatorname{E}[X_j]}{\\operatorname{E}[Y]} \\cdot c \\cdot \\operatorname{E} \\left [ Y \\cdot e^{cY/\\operatorname{E}[Y]} \\cdot \\left \\{ \\dfrac{X_j}{\\operatorname{E}[X_j]} - \\dfrac{Y}{\\operatorname{E}[Y]} \\right \\} \\right ]$\n\n    * Without the curly bracket it is just allocating $\\propto$ the mean\n\n    * Curly bracket (XS ratio factor) adjust for correlation, where BU that have large $X_j$ when Y is also large will have additional allocation; UBs that don't contribute to large losses will be negative in the curly bracket, receive reduced allocation\n    \nEPD\n\n* $r(X_j) = (CoTVaR - CoVaR) \\cdot (1-\\alpha)$\n\n* Only works when XS of a percentile\n\n***\n\nTable of Co-Measures\n\n| Risk Measure | $h(Y)$ | $L(Y)$ | Condition | Co-Measure |\n| ------------ | ------ | ------ | --------- | ---------- |\n| $TVaR$ | $Y$ | $1$ | $F(Y) > \\alpha$ | $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) > \\alpha]$ |\n| $VaR$ | $Y$ | $1$ | $F(Y) = \\alpha$ | $\\operatorname{E}[X_j \\mid F(Y) = \\alpha]$ |\n| Standard Deviation | $Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y]$ | $\\dfrac{Y - \\operatorname{E}[Y]}{\\sigma_Y}$ | none | $\\dfrac{\\operatorname{Cov}(X_j,Y)}{\\sigma_Y}$ |\n| $EPD$ | $X - \\operatorname{E}[X \\mid F(Y) = \\alpha]$ | $1-\\alpha$ | $F(Y) > \\alpha$ | $(CoTVaR - CoVaR) \\cdot (1-\\alpha)$ |\n\n### Using Decomposition\n\nIf the allocated risk measure $r(X_j)$ is a decomposition of the company risk measure $\\rho(Y)$ then we can use the measure to measure risk-adjusted profitability of a BU\n\n$\\dfrac{P_j}{r(X_j)}$\n\nWe also need $r(X_j) \\propto$ [Market Value of Risk] for this to be an appropriate metric\n\n* BU with higher ratio have more profit relative to the value of risk they are taking\n\nHowever, we don't know how to determine the market value of risk $\\Rightarrow$ Use several risk measures and hope that one is close and that the indicated strategic directions are consistent with each other\n\n* Question on how to determine the market value of risk have not been settle yet, likely a risk measure on a transformed probability but we don't know yet\n\n## Allocating the Cost of Capital\n\nCompare profitability among the BU by allocate a cost of capital for each BU\n\n2 possible definitions for cost of capital $C_j$\n\n* Option pricing: Value of the right to call upon the capital of the firm\n\n    * Difficult to value as the timing is not fixed in advanced\n    \n* Market value of a stop loss that attach at zero profits for the BU\n\n    * Could use the expected value of the stop loss on transformed probabilities\n    \n    * MET is recommended\n    \n    * Practical estimate: Mean + 30% of s.d. would apply a consistent risk load to the BU\n    \n## Summary\n\nAllocating capital, even using marginal decomposition is arbitrary and artificial\n\n* Arbitrary because different risk measures give us different allocations and therefore different answers\n\n* Artificial because the business unit has access to the entire capital of the firm, not just a portion of it\n\nUsing a value added approach, by allocating cost of capital is more economically realistic",
