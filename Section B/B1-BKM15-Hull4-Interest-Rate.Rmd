## Cliff's Summary

Covers the basic on the different rates, and bond pricing with bootstrap

[**FRA**](#FRA)

**Payoff**

$\dfrac{\overbrace{L(r_K - r_M)\overbrace{(T_2 - T_1)}^{\text{Pro-rate for Interval}}}^{\text{Payoff at }T_2}}{\underbrace{1 + r_M(T_2 - T_1)}_{\text{Discount to }T_1 \text{ from }T_2}}$

* $T_1$ and $T_2$ = beginning and end of the interval

* $r_M$ = Actual LIBOR rate at $T_1$ that applies between $T_1$ and $T_2$

* $r_k$ = fixed rate agreed for the FRA

* $L$ = principal

**Value** @ any point in time

$L(r_K - r_f)(T_2 - T_1)\underbrace{e^{-r_2T_2}}_{\text{Discount from }T_2}$

* $r_f$ = current forward rate that applies between $T_1$ and $T_2$

* $r_2$ = risk free spot rate for maturity $T_2$

### Types of Exam Questions

<span style="color:red">Haven't done TIA practice questions</span>

## Introduction

**Spot rate**:  
Interest rate that applies from time 0 to $t$; Yield to maturity (YtM) on zero coupon bonds (ZCB)

* = Zero rates

**Short rate**:  
Interest rate that will apply during a future time interval

* Can use short rates to determine spot rates (But not the other way around?)

**Treasury rates**:  
Rates earned on T-bills and T-bonds; Risk free

**LIBOR**:  
Rate at which a bank will make a large wholesale deposit with another bank; Close to risk free

**Repo rate**:  
The difference between the higher repurchase prices and the price sold at t=0

* Essentially a collateralized loan

## Interest Rate

$A \times \left(1 + \dfrac{R}{m} \right)^{m \cdot n}$

* Terminal value of $A$ invested for $n$ years at rate $R$ compounded $m$ times per annum

$A \times e^{R \cdot n}$

* Terminal value of $A$ invested for $n$ years at rate $R$ compounded continuously

## Bond Pricing

**Bond yield**: Single discount rate that would produce a bond price equal to is market value

**Par yield**: Rate which would produce a bond price = par

## Bootstrapping Method

To determine the zero rates (spot rates) based on price of coupon bonds

* Typically start with bonds that do not pay coupons

## Forward Rates

**Forward rate**: future expected short rates

$(1 + f_n) = \dfrac{(1+y_n)^n}{(1+y_{n-1})^{n-1}}$

* $f_n$ forward rate that applies during the future interval $n$

* $y_n$ spot rates

## Forward Rate Agreements (FRA)

<a name="FRA"></a>

**FRA**:  
Over the counter agreement between two parties to exchange a specified *interest rate* that applies to a specified *principal* during a specified *future interval*

* On party will pay a fixed rate and the other would pay a floating rate (e.g. LIBOR)

* Agreement is typically settled financially at the beginning of the interval based on the different between the fixed and actual floating rate

**FRA Payoff**

$\dfrac{\overbrace{L(r_K - r_M)\overbrace{(T_2 - T_1)}^{\text{Pro-rate for Interval}}}^{\text{Payoff at }T_2}}{\underbrace{1 + r_M(T_2 - T_1)}_{\text{Discount to }T_1 \text{ from }T_2}}$

* For the party that pays $r_M$ and receive $r_K$

* $T_1$ and $T_2$ = beginning and end of the interval

* $r_M$ = Actual LIBOR rate at $T_1$ that applies between $T_1$ and $T_2$

* $r_k$ = fixed rate agreed for the FRA

* $L$ = principal

**FRA Value** @ any point in time

$L(r_K - r_f)(T_2 - T_1)\underbrace{e^{-r_2T_2}}_{\text{Discount from }T_2}$

* $r_f$ = current forward rate that applies between $T_1$ and $T_2$

* $r_2$ = risk free spot rate for maturity $T_2$

* Discount from $T_2$ because the FRA is for the principal over the whole period

* Note that both $T_1$ and $T_2$ are both points in the future

## Theories of the Term Structure

**Yield curve**: Graph that shows the relationship between the interest rate and time to maturity

3 theories that explain the shape of the yield curve:

### Expectations Hypothese

Forward rate = expected future short rates $\Rightarrow$ Upward sloping yield curve is a signal that investors expect rate increases

### Liquidity Preference

Investors select bond that matures around the time that need the money to avoid interest rate and reinvestment risk

Liquidity premium is required to compensate short term investors for the interest rate risk they face

**Liquidity preferene theory**

Shape of the yield curve is influenced by the proportions of the different term investors

* Short term investors dominate $\Rightarrow$ Forward rates > expected spot rates $\Rightarrow$ Rising yield curve

* Vice versa

* There's some additional neuance with this... see old questions

### Segmentation Theory

Theory states that the short, medium and long term rates are independent

* Most large investors have certain maturities they are interested in and do not readily switch from them

* Different maturity bonds each find their equilibrium in their respective market based on supply and demand

$\hookrightarrow$ Rate for each maturity period is determined by the supply and demand for that specific maturity

### Interpretating the Term Structure

Consensus is that the expectation theory is correct

However the term structure may be impacted by other factors as well such as the liquidity premium (e.g. forward = expected short rate + liquidity premium) $\Rightarrow$ Impact of the additional factors will need to be removed

Yield curve can provide signs about the future business cycle:

* Steep (+) rise $\Rightarrow$ Market expects an expansion in economic activity

* (-) slope $\Rightarrow$ Interest rates are expected to decline
