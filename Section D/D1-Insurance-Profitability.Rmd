## Cliff's Summary

Looks at return on sales, asset, or equity

Opportunity cost 

* [Factors](#opp-cost-fac) that drives the opportunity cost 

* Calculation based on net cash flow (Premium - Loss - Expense) over the whole time horizon and discount with risk free rate

Premium credit should only be given for the investment income of policyholders fund

[Problem](#roe-prob) with ROE and ROS should be the focus of rate regulation (not rate of return equity)

Judge the current rate of return is appropriate or not by examining the structure of the industry; Signs of inadequate return:

* Increasing size of residual market
* Reducing degree of product diversity
* Reduced innovation

Difficult for analyst examining the financials to determine how they really are performing in a given year as management can influence the results by tempering with reserve

## Profitablity vs Rate of Return

**Profit**

Absolute number

Investors and management are interested in profit

Difficult to compare

**Rate of Return**

Profit as a % of:

* Equity
* Assets
* Sales

Measure of efficiency

Use for comparison

**Regulation**

Regulators focus on rate of return

Rate regulation is prospective

If applied retrospectively, be aware that a single year of experience is not sufficient to assess the true profitability of the business

## Opportunity Cost

Policyholders are losing out on some investment income as premiums are paid up front

<a name="opp-cost-fac"></a>

Factors that affect opportunity cost:

1) **LoB**: Opportunity cost is greater for LoBs with longer tail
2) Cash needed to support the **infrastructure** of the insurer

    * This cash is not invested and is tied up in infrastructure
    * Most are provided by prior policyholders and the current insureds are benefiting from them
    * Policyholders should not receive credit for the investment income from the money invested in infrastructure
    
Opportunity cost should be discounted at **risk free**

* Policyholder is not exposed to any of the risk of the investment
* Policyholders do not have to provide for the shortfall even if the insurer's investment lose money

***

Total Surplus = Policyholder Funds + Shareholder Funds

* Investment income is earned on the total surplus
* Investment income needs to be segmented between the 2 types of funds

Premium credit should only be given for the investment income of policyholders fund

* Surplus is not owned by the p/h
* Including surplus will penalize high surplus insurers as they will need to charge lower premiums

***

Calculation:

1) Determine net cash flow (Premium - Loss - Expense) over the whole time horizon
2) Discount with risk free rate

## ROE vs ROS

Return on equity vs return on sales (premium)

ROE compares the profit of the insurer to the owner's investment

### Problems of ROE

<a name="roe-prob"></a> **ROE vs Rate Equity**

Problem of focusing on ROE in rate regulation is that this forces the regulator to focus on ROE instead of rate equity

ROE can be distorted by the leverage ($\dfrac{\text{Premium}}{\text{Surplus}}$) of the insurer $\Rightarrow$ Concept of rate equity may not apply

* $\uparrow$ Surplus $\Rightarrow$ $\uparrow$ ROE

**Surplus Allocation**

Surplus allocation is artificial

Surplus allocation ignores the value of unallocated surplus

* e.g. 100M PHS company with 1M allocated vs 1M PHS company

**ROS is Simpler**

If surplus is allocated based on target P:S ratio, it would be more direct to regulate ROS directly

### ROS

Regulating ROS specifies an adequate profit margin as % of premium

* Similar to the concept of markup

ROS means a lot more to consumer than ROE

ROS is a true rate regulation because it does not depend on the relationship between premium and equity

## Profitability Standards

Insurer needs to charge an adequate rate of return that provides a margin of safety

* u/w profit provision needs to provide for an appropriate after tax return

If rates are inadequate $\Rightarrow$ Tighten u/w standards $\Rightarrow$ Reduce current volume

$\therefore$ Regulators can judge if the current rate of return is appropriate by examining the structure of the industry

Signs of inadequate return:

* Increasing size of residual market
* Reducing degree of product diversity
* Reduced innovation

## Uncertainty of Profitability

Lost of uncertainty in the estimation of losses for insurers

Management can influence the results by tempering with reserve

* Weaken reserves in poor year to reduce the size of u/w loss
* Strengthen reserves in a good year to provide some cushion for future years

Current u/w results will be affected by

* Current reserve decisions
* Amortization of past reserving decisions

$\therefore$ difficult for analyst examining the financials to determine how they really are performing in a given year
